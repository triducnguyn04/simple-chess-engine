# simple-chess-engine
To use the engine, simply run the main.py file. It comes with pygame GUI. There are some codes that I found interesting, but it's too inefficient or too puzzling so I don't use it in the engine. I put it in playground-code folder for future reference purposes. I will try to implement machine learning libraries to improve bot performance, standardize game notation and communication to make it able to play on lichess bot.

Hotkeys: 'z' for undoing a move, 'r' to reinitialize the board and start a new game.
