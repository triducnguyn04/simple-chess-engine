# simple-chess-engine
I love playing chess, but I don't play it too well (around 1700 Elo I guess). Here I code a chess engine from scratch to see if it can defeat me. The engine can calculate three moves in advanced, so it should be better than me in most of the situations. The goal of this project is to create an engine as strong and efficient as I can do, and probably register it on lichess.com to compete with other engines. I want to see its Elo rating! 

To use the engine, simply run the main.py file. It comes with pygame GUI. There are some codes that I found interesting, but it's too inefficient or too puzzling so I don't use it in the engine. I put it in playground-code folder for future reference purposes.

Hotkeys: 'z' for undoing a move, 'r' to reinitialize the board and start a new game.
